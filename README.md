# Password-Generator


**Description**

This Program was created to generate passwords based on information gathered from the user. It will generate a password from 8 to 128 characters. It can include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters based on the users input.

I specifically worked on the script.js file. I worked on the return function that generates the password. Within the return function I created prompts and confirms to collect user data, variables to store the user data, conditionals to confirm user choices and a loop to create the password based on the user choices.

**Installation**

Click on the settings tab.
Scroll down to the section that says GitHub Pages.
Click on the link in the green box next to "your site is published at".

If you enter a number that is less than 8 or greater than 28, you will get an alert that tells you to choose a number between 8 amd 128.
